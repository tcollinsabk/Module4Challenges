This has the same functionality as the regular chat bot, just with a GUI to get around issues with overrwriting text in the command line.
The server code is the exact same, but the client uses the WIN32 API to draw the GUI and handle inputs. The networking components are the same.

Contains a few issues:
- Limiting the chat window to 5000 characters will cause issues
- generally messy code
